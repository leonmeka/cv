This project was based on a [previous repository](https://github.com/claudiabdm/cvfy). It was mainly a learning experience getting to know the vue framework and as a way of finding out whether I could read, understand and modify other people's code. This project enhances said repository by adding several new functions, a new UI layout aswell as API integrations.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build

```
